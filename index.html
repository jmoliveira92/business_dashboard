  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

  <p>This project is a result of my learning process as a Data/Business Analyst from the last year and the knowledge I have acquired in businesses during the last 7 years. The project is a real-case and aims to assist a new company who needs to understand the photovoltaic industry and identifying their strengths and weaknesses. We must be able to operate and assess our performance in a timely and efficient manner. By analyzing our operations, we can identify areas where we excel and where we may need improvement, allowing us to adjust our strategies and investments accordingly. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that will enable the company to make informed decisions and drive the business towards success.</p>

  <h2>2. The Problem - Clarification Questions</h2>

  <p>The Board of Direction (companyâ€™s administration) needs a solution that allows them to track their business and understand some insights. To accomplish this task, I must build a business/operational dashboard that allows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>They want to know how is going the business (detail costs, revenue, profits, etc)</li>
    <li>Be possible to analyze each project in detail.</li>
    <li>Understand operatively where we are competitive and where we are not.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The start point of my journey: the company only has a time_logging app (to register the workers' time) and a simple accounting table.</p>

  <p>The previous step of my work was the creation and implementation of automated strategic data gathering procedures in order to create an efficient Data Model. However, due to their length, these procedures will not be detailed in this document.</p>
